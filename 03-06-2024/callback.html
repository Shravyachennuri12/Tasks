        console.log("A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some kind of operation or event has occurred. Callback functions are a key aspect of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, allowing code to continue running while waiting for long-running operations, such as network requests or file I/O, to complete.\n\n" +

                    "Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return functions are known as higher-order functions. The function passed as an argument is the callback function.\n\n" +
                    "Asynchronous Operations:\n\n" +
                    "Callbacks are often used with asynchronous operations to handle results once the operations are complete. Common scenarios include event handling, network requests, and timers.\n\n" +

                    "The callback function is not executed immediately but is called once the operation completes or an event occurs.");
